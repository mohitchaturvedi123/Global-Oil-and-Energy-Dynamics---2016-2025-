This project provides a **data-driven analysis** of global oil and energy trade dynamics, focusing on:
- The impact of geopolitical events (Russia–Ukraine war, sanctions, OPEC+ decisions)
- India & China’s increasing reliance on discounted Russian oil
- Shifts in U.S. energy exports to Europe
- The correlation between oil prices and inflation

## Key Insights
- Sanctions had limited impact as Russia pivoted to Asia.  
- India & China benefited from discounted oil.
- The U.S. and its energy companies not only profited from the surge in global oil prices but also benefited from Europe’s ban on Russian energy.
- As the EU shifted to U.S. supplies, America emerged as a key replacement supplier — boosting profits nearly five-fold.
- Oil prices show strong correlation (r=0.87) with inflation.  
- Energy flows remain profit-driven, overriding morality/ethics.  
- Both the U.S. and EU were unable to completely block or eliminate trade with Russia due to reliance on critical resources.
